### Now you can keep track of your writings statistics!

Writers's Trail is a tool designed by a writer for writers so they can see charts and statistics about their custom defined projects and targets. This web application asks for your writing sessions and generate useful information from inserted data.

## Features

### Custom targets with progress charts

![Target](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/target.png)

Now you can have that [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org) feel any time in the year. Create targets for any amount of words and time you want.

Life got in the way? Change the target midway to something you know you can make.

Or increase the target word count if it got too easy.

### Register your writing sessions

![Session](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/session.png)

Know all the time you have written. Keep notes for yourself about how you felt in that session.

You can make a summary to make it easier to find a specific session later on.

### Visualize your progress

![Projects](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/projects.png)

Individual progress bars for each project, unrelated to defined targets.

See how close you are of finishing that pet project of yours.

Mark projects as finished and/or inactive. Inactive projects will be hidden from the main dashboard.

### See your writing habits

![Stats](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/stats.png)

You can see a summary of your statistics and know what are the best session length for you.

Know how much you have written and the period of day you are most productive.

### Application settings

![Settings](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/settings.png)

Choose your preferred date and time format and select which data you'll see in your targets charts by default.

Reset the application tour or cancel it any time you want.

### Custom genres

![Genres](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/genres.png)

Classify your projects in any way you want. A default set is provided but you can add, remove or change them at your will.

If you want to set genres as formats (novel, short story, essay, etc.) that's fine too! Writer's Trail is meant to be very customizable.

### Timer and chronometer

![Timer](http://writerstrail.georgemarques.com.br/images/timer.png)

Time your sessions on the web page and have the fields filled for you. If you see yourself using always the same session length, you can also define a default timer in your settings.

Also, there's a chat on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/flikore/writerstrail) where anyone can discuss ideas about features, bugs and suggestions in real time.
